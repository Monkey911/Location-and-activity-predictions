    "3. I start looking occurances dataframe row by row and return my first location predictions.\n",
    "    * for each row I check if the occurance count is smaller or equals with wrong_signal_count(a parameter in main function).\n",
    "        * If the count is smaller or equal then I remove it if it was possible to get from previous room into next room. (only exception is a moment, when on room change two sensors detected motion at the same time and then I prefer the new room)\n",
    "        * Otherwise I fill add the room into our result.\n",
    "4. Now I start adding toilet, stairs and \n",
    "    * If the person is in the landing long enough (there's a parameter for determing it) and the signal is missing during that time long enough (also a parameter for that) then we will add toilet.\n",
    "    * If the person moves from landing to hall or from hall to landing then we will add stairs between them.\n",
    "    * If the person goes to hall and disapears from there for some time, then I will add porch. (It also might happen when the person is in lounge according to pir sensors)\n",
    "5. Now I change the border datetimes. Previously I took more data, than I was asked to so I can make better predictions on exact starting and ending time. Now I remove the predictions from the borders and return exactly the information that was between given borders.\n",
    "6. I will check if all the room changes are possible I print some messages if they aren't so I would know that something is wrong."
